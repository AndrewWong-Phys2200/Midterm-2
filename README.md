Midterm-2 Project: Structure of White Dwarf Stars
=========

The purpose of this project is to derive and solve the dimensionless differential equations that describe the radial 
mass distribution inside a white dwarf star. The code outputs results in a res1 file, and dwarf.png shows the radius 
vs mass of a white dwarf star for the dimensionless central densities 0.1 to 1,000,000.

The following first order dimensionless differential equations are used:

m' = r^2*p

p' = (-3*m*p*sqrt(1+p^(2/3))) / (r^2*p^(2/3))

Here, m' is the dimensionless mass of the star, p' (rho), is the dimensionless density, and r the dimensionless radius of the star.

 

Mass of a White Dwarf vs Radius

Mass is on the vertical axis and radius is on the horizontal axis. 

As seen above, as the radius of the star gets smaller, the mass actually gets larger. This makes sense since 
the star is not supported by the heat generated by fusion against gravitational collapse. Being supported only by electron pressure causes the star to be extremely dense.
