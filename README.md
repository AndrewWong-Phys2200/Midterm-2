Midterm-2 Project: Structure of White Dwarf Stars
=========

The purpose of this project is to derive and solve the dimensionless differential equations that describe the radial 
mass distribution inside a white dwarf star. The code outputs results in a res1 file, and dwarf.png shows the radius 
vs mass of a white dwarf star for the dimensionless central densities 0.1 to 1,000,000.
